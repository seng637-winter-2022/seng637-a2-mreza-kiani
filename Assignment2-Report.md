# 1 Introduction

In this assignment, we want to test 5 methods for 2 classes of the JFreeChart library.
The technique that we are going to use is black-box testing, and our system under test (SUT) is a jar file.
JFreeChart is an open-source library for chart calculation, creation, and display. This framework supports different
chart types, such as pie charts, bar charts, line charts, histograms, etc. We also have access to its related Javadoc.
First, we have to read the java doc and also run the available demo to get more familiar with the JFreeChart.
Then we should write tests for 5 methods of DataUtilities class and 5 other methods in the Range class.
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that focuses on the functionality of an application without knowing 
the internal code structure, implementation details, and internal paths. Black Box Testing mainly uses the input
and output of the applications. We added all our test cases in the _src_ directory. Also, the required libraries are
inside the _lib_ directory. For running the project, you should open the project with an IDE like IntelliJ. 
Then you should open the _Project Structure_ and add the libraries to the project. Then you will be able to run the 
test suits that we wrote for each class.

# 3 Test cases developed

For this section, please refer to the [Excel](https://github.com/seng637-winter-2022/seng637-a2-mreza-kiani/blob/main/SENG637-A2.pptx) file located the main directory.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We divided the methods into three parts (3, 4, 3), and after planning the tests, we wrote our test cases.
Then, each of us double-checked the test cases of the others.
In the end, we added 2 test suites for running the whole tests for a class together.
Finally, we answered all of the questions of the report separately and merged them at the end.
It's worth mentioning that we used Discord for our communication and Zoom meeting for capturing the demo.
