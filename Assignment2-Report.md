# 1 Introduction

In this assignment, we want to test 5 methods for 2 classes of the JFreeChart library.
The technique that we are going to use is black-box testing, and our system under test (SUT) is a jar file.
JFreeChart is an open-source library for chart calculation, creation, and display. This framework supports different
chart types, such as pie charts, bar charts, line charts, histograms, etc. We also have access to its related Javadoc.
First, we have to read the java doc and also run the available demo to get more familiar with the JFreeChart.
Then we should write tests for 5 methods of DataUtilities class and 5 other methods in the Range class.
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that focuses on the functionality of an application without knowing 
the internal code structure, implementation details, and internal paths. Black Box Testing mainly uses the input
and output of the applications. We added all our test cases in the _src_ directory. Also, the required libraries are
inside the _lib_ directory. For running the project, you should open the project with an IDE like IntelliJ. 
Then you should open the _Project Structure_ and add the libraries to the project. Then you will be able to run the 
test suits that we wrote for each class.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

First we ran the JFreeChart demo to get familiar with the library and its features. Then we took a look at the Javadoc
for the two Range & DataUtilities class, and tried to know their methods. For each method, we tried to use specific
technique to do black box testing. The technique we used are:

* Equivalence class testing
* Boundary value analysis
* Robustness testing
* Worst case testing

By using these techniques, we tried to cover all the expected behaviour of a method. In some cases, more specifically
for DataUtilities class, we used mocking to mimic the behaviour of a not-implemented or complex class, so then we were
able to continue our unit testing. But there was a main disadvantage of using a mock object:
It is very coupled with the unit tests. In fact, sometimes the unit test is working based on the expected behaviour of
our mock. And if we use mocks more than it's necessary, our testing maintenance would go rise.

Finally, we tested 5 methods of Range class and 5 methods of DataUtilities class. You can see specific description for
each one in the table bellow:

| Class         |       Method Name       |                                                                         Description                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Testing Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The different is that here we controlled the tests using different height size.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

# 3 Test cases developed

For this section, please refer to the [Excel](https://github.com/seng637-winter-2022/seng637-a2-mreza-kiani/blob/main/Test%20Cases.xlsx) file located the main directory.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We divided the methods into three parts (3, 4, 3), and after planning the tests, we wrote our test cases.
Then, each of us double-checked the test cases of the others.
In the end, we added 2 test suites for running the whole tests for a class together.
Finally, we answered all of the questions of the report separately and merged them at the end.
It's worth mentioning that we used Discord for our communication and Zoom meeting for capturing the demo.
